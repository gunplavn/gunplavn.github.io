# Panel Lining Tutorial for Beginners

Panel lining is one of the easiest ways to dramatically improve the look of your Gunpla. It adds depth and brings out the mechanical details of your kit.

## What is Panel Lining?

Panel lining involves filling in the recessed lines (panel lines) on your model with a darker color to create contrast and make the details pop.

## Methods

### 1. Gundam Markers

**Best for**: Absolute beginners

Simply trace the lines with the fine tip marker, then clean up with an eraser or cotton swab.

**Pros**: Easy, no mess
**Cons**: Can be thick, harder to control

### 2. Tamiya Panel Line Accent

**Best for**: Intermediate builders

<strong>My Recommendation!</strong><br>
This is my go-to method. The enamel-based wash flows into panel lines automatically through capillary action.

**Steps:**
1. Apply a small amount to the panel line
2. Watch it flow into the recesses
3. Wait 10-15 minutes to dry
4. Clean excess with enamel thinner on a cotton swab

### 3. Fine-tip Pens

Sakura Pigma Micron pens (0.05mm) work great for precise work.

## Color Choices

| Base Color | Recommended Panel Line Color |
|------------|------------------------------|
| White      | Gray or Light Black          |
| Red        | Dark Brown or Black          |
| Blue       | Dark Blue or Black           |
| Yellow     | Orange or Brown              |
| Black      | Gray                         |

## Before & After

The difference is dramatic! A simple panel line wash can take your straight build from "toy" to "model" instantly.

Practice on an old kit first, and don't be afraid to make mistakes - that's how we learn!
